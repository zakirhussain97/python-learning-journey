# Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Python Learning Journey**! 🐍

This repository is an open diary of my progress as I learn Python programming. Here, I share my:
- Daily and weekly learning notes
- Code snippets and challenges I’ve solved
- Reflections on what I found easy, hard, or surprising
- Projects I built along the way
- Helpful resources I discovered

## Why I Made This Repo

I want to track my growth, document what I learn, keep myself accountable, and hopefully inspire or help other learners by being transparent about my process—including my successes and failures.

## What You’ll Find Here

- `notes/` – My written notes, “aha!” moments, or topics I’m studying
- `code-experiments/` – Python programs, toy scripts, and exercises
- `projects/` – Mini-projects to practice applying new concepts
- `resources.md` – Curated links, videos, courses, and docs I find useful
- `reflections.md` – My honest thoughts, struggles, and wins

## How To Use This

Feel free to browse, comment, and offer suggestions or encouragement! If you are on your own learning path, I hope my notes or mistakes will encourage you, too.

## License

All code and writing are under the MIT License—use, modify, or share as you wish.
